- This will likely be a place I put Math and Science related repositories.
- I may use this for sharing papers or other non software development projects.
- One of my big interests is data science and machine learning. This will be the spot I share my findings.

- The place I currently keep all of my software projects, is at [github.com/jakeroggenbuck](https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck)
